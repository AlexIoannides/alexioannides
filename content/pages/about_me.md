Title: About Me
Date: 2024-05-22

I lead AI/ML engineering teams, preferring to remain actively engaged in all aspects of technical delivery. I've helped develop several ML systems, as well as tools, frameworks and platforms to accelerate and scale deployments. You can find examples of all this on this blog and on [GitHub](https://github.com/AlexIoannides).

I'm a seasoned software engineer and a recovering financial mathematician whose academic journey includes a PhD in Computational Neuroscience from UCL, where I investigated the intersection of computer vision and human visual cognition.
