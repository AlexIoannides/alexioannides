Title: About Me
Date: 2020-08-02

I am currently employed by [LiveMore Capital](http://www.livemorecapital.com) - an originate-to-distribute mortgage lender focusing on Retirement Interest Only (RIO) loans. I am a hands-on Chief Data Officer looking after the development of our data platform and all data engineering, machine learning and credit modelling activities.

Prior to that I worked at [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com) within their Adaptive Intelligent Apps team, automating work-flows used to train, deploy and monitor the machine learning models embedded throughout Oracle’s cloud applications.

I came to Oracle from [Perfect Channel](https://www.perfectchannel.com) - a medium-sized (fin)tech scale-up and provider of B2B transactional platforms, where I was responsible for the research and development of trading algorithms and machine learning services that enabled clients to derive value from trade-event data – e.g. by price-optimisation, inventory recommendation and the automated matching of buyers to sellers.

Before all this, I spent a lot of time thinking about credit derivatives and credit risk, in particular counterparty credit risk. So I know a thing or two about stochastic processes, time-series data, Monte Carlo methods and quantitative finance in general.

Going back even further, I once devoted three years of my life to research in computational neuroscience - more specifically the 'early' visual system and how it decodes visual information and turns it into perception. I got a PhD from [University College London (UCL)](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/) out of this endeavor and learnt a lot about statistical learning, neural networks and machine vision along the way - before any of this stuff was as powerful and popular as it is now.

After what seems like donkey's years - prior to completing three degrees, working several jobs, getting married and becoming a father - I was obsessed with theoretical physics. I remain fascinated by this wonderful subject and I think studying physics made me good at solving problems, as well as long algebra-heavy derivations that consumed a lot of chalk. Luckily for me, I've been able to make a living out of solving interesting problems.

When there's spare time I [ride and race bicycles](https://www.strava.com/athletes/2026116), [write code](https://github.com/AlexIoannides) (for fun!), drink [good coffee ](https://www.hasbean.co.uk) and listen to [house, techno and electronica](https://soundcloud.com/user-616657739/sets) (with a soft-spot for UK rave from the early 90s).
