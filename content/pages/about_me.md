Title: About Me
Date: 2024-05-22

I lead AI/ML engineering teams and like to keep my hands dirty shipping code with everyone else. I've helped develop several ML systems, as well as the tools, frameworks and platforms that support them. You can find examples of all this on this blog and on [GitHub](https://github.com/AlexIoannides).

I'm a seasoned software engineer and a former financial mathematician whose academic journey includes a PhD in Computational Neuroscience from UCL, where I investigated the intersection of computer vision and human visual cognition.
