Title: About Me
Date: 2020-08-02

I am currently a Solutions Architect for [Databricks](https://databricks.com), working closely with customers at the early stages of commercial engagement, helping them to solve their data and machine learning problems using the Databricks platform.

I am also the co-founder of [Bodywork Machine Learning](https://www.bodyworkml.com), the creators of [Bodywork](https://bodywork.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) - an open-source MLOps framework used by machine learning engineers to automate the deployment and execution of model-training workloads and model-scoring services, on Kubernetes.

Prior to this, I have worked with technology companies large and small, developing solutions to their data engineering and machine learning problems: I was Chief Data Officer for [LiveMore Capital](https://livemorecapital.com), where I built a cloud-based data platform to support their credit analytics and modelling activities; I worked within Oracle’s [Adaptive Intelligent Apps](https://www.oracle.com/applications/ai-apps/) team, automating workflows used to train, deploy and monitor machine learning models embedded within Oracle’s cloud applications; and prior to all this I worked for [Perfect Channel](https://www.perfectchannel.com), a medium-sized FinTech scale-up and provider of B2B transactional platforms, where I was responsible for the research and development of trading algorithms, and machine learning services that enabled clients to derive value from trade-event data.

Before moving into the world of data science and machine learning I spent several years working as a ‘quant analyst' within London's financial services sector. I was primarily focused on pricing and modelling the credit risk on derivative trades. So I know a thing or two about stochastic processes, time-series data, Monte Carlo methods and financial mathematics.

Going back even further, I graduated from [UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/) with a PhD in Computational Neuroscience, that explored how machine-vision techniques can be used to better understand human visual cognition. I learnt a lot about statistical learning and neural networks - before any of this stuff was as powerful and popular as it is now. I also have a background in theoretical physics.

I am very hands-on and have developed mathematical software programs for over 20 years, touching many programming languages along the way: Python, Scala, R, C#, C++, VBA, Java and Fortran. Currently, I have a **strong** preference for developing everything in Python (albeit in a functional style) and deploying to Kubernetes.

When there’s spare time I [ride and race bicycles](https://www.strava.com/athletes/2026116), [write code](https://github.com/AlexIoannides) (for fun!), drink [good coffee](https://www.hasbean.co.uk) and listen to [house, techno and electronica](https://soundcloud.com/user-616657739/sets) (with a soft-spot for UK rave from the early 90s).
