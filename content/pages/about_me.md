Title: About Me
Date: 2021-04-15

I am one of the founders of [Bodywork Machine Learning](https://www.bodyworkml.com) , the creators of [Bodywork](https://bodywork.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) - an open-source MLOps tool that is used to deploy machine learning projects developed in Python, to Kubernetes.

I’ve worked with technology companies large and small, developing solutions to data engineering and machine learning problems: I was Chief Data Officer for [LiveMore Capital](https://livemorecapital.com), where I built a data platform to support their credit analytics and modelling activities; I worked with Oracle’s [Adaptive Intelligent Apps](https://www.oracle.com/applications/ai-apps/) team, automating workflows used to train, deploy and monitor the machine learning models embedded throughout Oracle’s cloud applications; and prior to all this I worked for [Perfect Channel](https://www.perfectchannel.com), a medium-sized FinTech scale-up and provider of B2B transactional platforms, where I was responsible for the research and development of trading algorithms, and machine learning services that enabled clients to derive value from trade-event data.

Before moving into the world of data science and machine learning I spent several years working as a quantitative analyst within London’s financial services sector. I was primarily focused on pricing and modelling the credit risk on derivative trades. So I know a thing or two about stochastic processes, time-series data, Monte Carlo methods and financial mathematics.

Going back even further, I graduated from [UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/) with a PhD in Computational Neuroscience, that explored how machine-vision techniques can be used to better understand human visual cognition. I learnt a lot about statistical learning and neural networks - before any of this stuff was as powerful and popular as it is now. I also have a background in theoretical physics.

I am very hands-on and have developed mathematical software programs for over 20 years, touching many programming languages along the way: Python, Scala, R, C#, C++, VBA, Java and Fortran. Currently, I have a **strong** preference for developing everything in Python (albeit in a functional style) and deploying to Kubernetes.

When there’s spare time I [ride and race bicycles](https://www.strava.com/athletes/2026116), [write code](https://github.com/AlexIoannides) (for fun!), drink [good coffee](https://www.hasbean.co.uk) and listen to [house, techno and electronica](https://soundcloud.com/user-616657739/sets) (with a soft-spot for UK rave from the early 90s).
