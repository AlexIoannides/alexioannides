Title: About Me
Date: 2023-08-07

I am a leader of ML engineering and data science teams who still likes to get his hands dirty solving data problems and writing code. I have many years of experience with a specialism in the development of tools, frameworks and platforms for scaling the deployment of data science throughout an organisation.

I'm also one of the founders of [Bodywork Machine Learning](https://www.bodyworkml.com), where we've been developing open-source tools and best-practices for ML engineers. We've helped teams build ML systems using [bodywork-core](https://bodywork.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to deploy ML pipelines and models without requiring anyone to get involved in containerisation, orchestration and infrastructure.

I've helped many companies large and small develop solutions to their data and ML problems: I've led a team of ML engineers at [Lloyds Banking Group](https://www.lloydsbankinggroup.com), developed a data platform to support the credit analytics and modelling activities of [LiveMore Capital](https://livemorecapital.com); worked with Oracle’s [AI Apps](https://www.oracle.com/applications/ai-apps/) team, automating workflows for training, deploying and monitoring models; and prior to all this I worked for [NovaFori](https://www.novafori.com), a FinTech scale-up and provider of B2B transactional platforms, where I was responsible for the research and development of trading algorithms and ML systems that enabled clients to derive value from trade-event data.

Before moving into the world of data science and ML, I spent seven years working as a financial mathematician, pricing and modelling the credit risk on derivative trades. So I know a thing or two about time-series data, Monte Carlo methods, stochastic processes and Black-Scholes.

Going back even further, I graduated from [UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/) with a PhD in Computational Neuroscience that explored how computer vision models can further our understanding of human visual cognition. I learnt a lot about statistical learning and neural networks - before any of this stuff was as powerful and popular as it is today. This came after degrees in systems biology and theoretical physics.

I'm an experienced software engineer who's comfortable with Agile ways-of-working, modern DevOps practices and cloud-based distributed systems. I have had operational responsibility for many production services throughout my career.

When there’s spare time I [ride and race bicycles](https://www.strava.com/athletes/2026116), [write code](https://github.com/AlexIoannides) (for fun!), drink [good coffee](https://www.hasbean.co.uk) and listen to [house, techno and electronica](https://soundcloud.com/user-616657739/sets).
