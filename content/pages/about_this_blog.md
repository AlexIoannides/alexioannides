Title: About this Blog
Date: 2024-05-22

Although I am interested in [many things]({filename}about_me.md), this blog is focused on the disciplines of *data science*,  *AI/ML engineering and operations*. Given that these are nebulous and over-used catch-all phrases I'll be more specific - this is a blog about everything that's involved in turning raw data into *information* that one could *do something with*, via tangible *end products* that deliver *value* to someone or something.

As I see it, this covers the methods and tools used for:

* data ingestion, storage and transformation;
* feature engineering;
* training models;
* engineering end-to-end AI/ML systems; and,
* automating the production of results, decisions and actions of any kind.

I am particularly interested in Python and the 'PyData stack' (NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, PyTorch, PYMC3, ...), Apache Spark, Docker and Kubernetes - all from an OS X user's frame of reference. These are my day-to-day tools along with pencil and (squared) paper.
