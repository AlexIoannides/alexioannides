Title: About this Blog
Date: 2018-09-09

Although I am interested in [many things](http://alexioannides.github.io/pages/about-me), this blog is focused on the discipline that is 'data science'. Given that this is a nebulous and over-used catch-all phrase I'll be more specific - this is a blog about everything that's involved in turning raw data into information that one could 'do something' with. As I see it, this covers the methods and tools used for:

* data storage,
* data extraction and transformation (ETL),
* data exploration,
* data modeling,
* serving-up results.

I am particularly interested in Python, Scala, Spark, the Elasticsearch stack and AWS, all from an OS X user's frame of reference. These are my day-to-day tools along with pencil and (squared) paper.
